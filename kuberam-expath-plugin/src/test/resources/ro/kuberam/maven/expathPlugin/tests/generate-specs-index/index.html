            services,
            which consists of a set of XPath 2.0 extension functions related to XML Digital Signature,
            encryption and decryption, and
            checking of integrity and authentication of data. It has been designed to be compatible
            with XQuery 1.0
            and XSLT 2.0, as well as any other standard based on XPath 2.0. Table of Contents

            1 IntroductionCryptography is the science of communicating in secret code, by conversion
            of data with
            the help of a key. In modern times, cryptography is necessary when communicating over
            any untrusted medium, particularly the Internet.Encryption of data can be of two types:
            symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric encryption
            means that the same key is used for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption
            means that a message can be encrypted by using a key that is public, but the decryption
            can be made only by using a private key, which form a pair with the respective public
            key.A related technique of cryptography is to apply a one-way hash or digest function
            to
            data; replicating the operation with the same data and function can check the integrity
            and authentication of the data.
            1.1 Namespace conventionsThe module defined by this document defines functions and
            elements in the namespace
            http://expath.org/ns/crypto. In this document, the
            crypto prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace URI.Error codes are defined in
            the namespace http://expath.org/ns/error. In
            this document, the err prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace
            URI.
            1.2 Error managementError conditions are identified by a code (a QName). When such
            an error
            condition is reached during the execution of the function, a dynamic error is thrown,
            with the corresponding error code (as if the standard XPath function
            error had been called). 
            2 Cryptographic Service ProvidersCryptographic providers provide cryptographic services,
            involving cryptographic operations (encryption, digital signatures, message digests,
            message authentication), 
            generators and converters of cryptographic material and cryptographic objects (keystores
            or certificates) containing the cryptographic data. They can be implemented
            using software, hardware, or both.Cryptographic services described by this specificationCryptographic
            Service QNameCryptographic Service Descriptioncrypto:hashSee 3.1 The crypto:hash function.crypto:hmacSee
            3.2 The crypto:hmac function.
            2.1 The crypto:list-providers functionThis function lists the available cryptographic
            providers.
            crypto:list-providers() as element(crypto:provider-list)
            
            2.1.1 The crypto:providers-list elementThe crypto:providers-list element represents
            the list of the available cryptographic providers:
            &lt;crypto:providers-list&gt;
            (crypto:provider*)
            &lt;/crypto:providers-list&gt;
            
            2.1.2 The crypto:provider elementThe crypto:provider element contains the name of
            an available cryptographic provider:
            &lt;crypto:provider name = xs:string
            version = xs:string&gt;
            &lt;/crypto:provider&gt;
            
            2.2 The crypto:list-services functionThis function lists the cryptographic services
            a provider provides.
            crypto:list-services($provider-name as xs:string) as element(crypto:service-list)
            $provider-name is the provider's name. TBD: case when provider is not registered,
            etc.
            2.2.1 The crypto:services-list elementThe crypto:services-list element represents
            the list of the available cryptographic services for a provider:
            &lt;crypto:services-list&gt;
            (crypto:service*)
            &lt;/crypto:services-list&gt;
            
            2.2.2 The crypto:service elementThe crypto:service element contains details about
            an available cryptographic service:
            &lt;crypto:service qname = xsd:QName
            algorithm? = xs:string
            type? = xs:string
            format? = xs:string?/&gt;
            
            3 Integrity and Authentication of Data
            3.1 The crypto:hash functionThis function generates a "message digest" of the input
            data, by using a cryptographic algorithm. It returns the hash value as base64 string.
            crypto:hash($data as xs:anyAtomicType,
            $hashing-algorithm as xs:string,
            $provider as xs:string?) as xs:string
            $data is the data to be hashed. This parameter can be of type xs:string, xs:base64Binary,
            or xs:hexBinary.$algorithm is the cryptographic hashing algorithm. If it is specified
            an unsupported algorithm, this
            is an error [err:CX21].$provider is the cryptographic provider for the current operation.
            If the provider is not specified, the implementation will use the
            default provider. If the provider does not exist, this is an error [err:CX23].
            3.2 The crypto:hmac functionHMAC (Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication) is a mechanism
            for message authentication using
            cryptographic hash functions. HMAC can be used with any iterative cryptographic hash
            function, e.g.
            MD5 or SHA-1, in combination with a secret shared key. Typically, message authentication
            codes are
            used between two parties that share a secret key in order to validate information
            transmitted
            between these parties.This function generates a message authentication code, based
            on the input message, by
            using a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key. It returns the hash-based message
            authentication code as base64 string.
            crypto:hmac($data as xs:anyAtomicType,
            $secret-key as xs:anyAtomicType,
            $hashing-algorithm as xs:string,
            $provider as xs:string?) as xs:string
            $data is the data to be authenticated. This parameter can be of type xs:string, xs:base64Binary,
            or xs:hexBinary.$secret-key is the secret key used for calculating the authentication
            code. This parameter can be of type
            xs:string, xs:base64Binary, or xs:hexBinary.$algorithm is the cryptographic hashing
            algorithm. If it is specified an unsupported algorithm, this
            is an error [err:CX21].$provider is the cryptographic provider for the current operation.
            If the provider is not specified, the implementation will use the
            default provider. If the provider does not exist, this is an error [err:CX23]. 
            4 Key ManagementTBD.
            4.1 The crypto:generate-key-pair functionThis function generates a new pair of public
            and private cryptographic keys, to be used with a specific cryptographic algorithm.
            4.2 The crypto:generate-secret-key functionThis function generates a new secret key,
            to be used with a specific cryptographic algorithm.

            4.4 The crypto:key-agrement functionhttp://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2631.txt, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#KeyAgreement
            4.5 The crypto:convert-key-specification-to-key-object, crypto:convert-key-object-to-key-specification
            functionhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#KeyFactory,
            http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#SecretKeyFactory
            (for secret (symmetric) keys)
            
            5 Digital SignatureThe XML Signature is a method of associating a key with referenced
            data (octets); it
            does not normatively specify how keys are associated with persons or institutions,
            nor
            the meaning of the data being referenced and signed. XML Signatures are applied to
            arbitrary digital content (data objects) via an indirection. Data objects are digested,
            the resulting value is placed in an element (with other information) and that element
            is
            then digested and cryptographically signed.
            5.1 The crypto:generate-signature functionThis function has four signatures, as one
            have to consider that some applications
            require the ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information
            content to be signed (this is done by using XPath to indicate the subset), and also
            the ability to use a digital certificate to obtain the key pair, instead of an
            auto-generated key pair.The first signature considers the case of auto-generated key
            pair, and signature for
            the whole document.The second signature considers the case of auto-generated key pair,
            and signature for
            a subset of the document.The third signature considers the case of key pair generated
            from an digital
            certificate, and signature for the whole document. The fourth signature considers
            the case of key pair generated from an digital
            certificate, and signature for a subset of the document. 
            crypto:generate-signature($data as node(),
            $canonicalization-algorithm as xs:string,
            $digest-algorithm as xs:string,
            $signature-algorithm as xs:string,
            $signature-namespace-prefix as xs:string,
            $signature-type as xs:string) as node()
            
            crypto:generate-signature($data as node(),

            $signature-algorithm as xs:string,
            $signature-namespace-prefix as xs:string,
            $signature-type as xs:string,
            $xpath-expression as xs:string) as node()
            
            crypto:generate-signature($data as node(),
            $canonicalization-algorithm as xs:string,
            $digest-algorithm as xs:string,
            $signature-algorithm as xs:string,
            $signature-namespace-prefix as xs:string,
            $signature-type as xs:string,
            $digital-certificate as node()) as node()
            
            crypto:generate-signature($data as node(),
            $canonicalization-algorithm as xs:string,
            $digest-algorithm as xs:string,
            $signature-algorithm as xs:string,
            $signature-namespace-prefix as xs:string,
            $signature-type as xs:string,
            $xpath-expression as xs:string,
            $digital-certificate as node()) as node()            
            $data is the data to be signed.$canonicalization-algorithm is the canonicalization
            algorithm
            applied to the SignedInfo element prior to performing signature calculations.
            Possible values are: "exclusive", "exclusive-with-comments", "inclusive", and
            "inclusive-with-comments". The default value is "inclusive-with-comments". If
            the parameter specifies an unsupported algorithm, this is an error [err:CX01].$digest-algorithm
            is the digest algorithm to be applied to the
            signed object. Possible values are: "SHA1", "SHA256", and "SHA512". The default
            value is "SHA1". If the parameter specifies an unsupported algorithm, this is
            an error [err:CX02].$signature-algorithm is the algorithm used for signature
            generation and validation. Possible values are: "DSA_SHA1", and "RSA_SHA1". The
            default value is "RSA_SHA1". If the parameter specifies an unsupported
            algorithm, this is an error [err:CX03].$signature-namespace-prefix is the namespace
            prefix for
            signature.$signature-type is the method used for signing the content of
            signature. Possible values are: 'enveloping', 'enveloped', and 'detached'. The
            default value is 'enveloped'.$xpath-expression is the XPath expression used for selecting
            the
            subset to be signed. If the XPath expression is invalid, this is an error
            [err:CX04].$digital-certificate is the digital certificate to be used for
            signing the input document or document subset. The structure of this parameter
            is as follows (this is an example):
            &lt;digital-certificate&gt;
            &lt;keystore-type&gt;JKS&lt;/keystore-type&gt;
            &lt;keystore-password&gt;ab987c&lt;/keystore-password&gt;
            &lt;key-alias&gt;eXist&lt;/key-alias&gt;
            &lt;private-key-password&gt;kpi135&lt;/private-key-password&gt;
            &lt;keystore-uri&gt;/db/mykeystoreEXist&lt;/keystore-uri&gt;
            &lt;/digital-certificate&gt;The following errors can be raised relative to the structure
            and content of
            $digital-certificate parameter: [err:CX05], [err:CX07], [err:CX08],
            [err:CX09], [err:CX10], [err:CX11], and [err:CX12].
            5.2 The crypto:validate-signature functionThis function validates an XML Digital Signature.
            crypto:validate-signature($data as node()) as xs:boolean$data is the enveloped, enveloping,
            or detached signature. If
            the Signature element cannot be found, this is an error [err:CX15]. 
            6 Encryption and DecryptionEncryption represents the process of conversion of data,
            by using a secret key (a
            cipher), in a form (called cipher text) that cannot be understood by unautorized
            persons.The decryption represents the reverse process, of converting encrypted data
            back to
            plain text (original text).There are two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption,
            when both parties, the
            sender and the receiver, use the same secret key, previously exchanged, and asymmetric
            encryption, when a key pair, consisting of a private key and a private key, is used,
            of
            which the public key is used by sender to encrypt a message that can only be decrypted
            by the receiver, who holds the private key of that key pair.
            6.1 The crypto:encrypt functionThis function encrypts data.
            crypto:encrypt($data as xs:anyAtomicType,
            $encryption-type as xs:string,
            $secret-key as xs:anyAtomicType,
            $cryptographic-algorithm as xs:string,
            $vi as xs:string?,
            $provider as xs:string?) as xs:anyAtomicType$data is the data to be encrypted. This
            parameter can be of type xs:string, xs:base64Binary, or xs:hexBinary.
            When a particular padding mechanism is requested, but is not available, this is an
            error [err:CX16]. Also, when a particular padding mechanism is expected, but
            the data is not padded properly, this is an error [err:CX17].
            $encryption-type is the type of encryption. Legal values:
            "symmetric", and "asymmetric". If the parameter has an illegal value, this is
            an error [err:CX18].$secret-key is the secret key used for encryption. This parameter
            can be of type xs:string,
            xs:base64Binary, or xs:hexBinary. If the key is invalid, this is an error [err:CX19].
            If the length of
            data provided to the block cipher is incorrect, this is an error [err:CX20].$cryptographic-algorithm
            is the cryptographic algorithm used for encryption. For symmetric encryption, a transformation
            name can be used.
            If the parameter specifies an unsupported algorithm or transformation name, this is
            an error [err:CX21].$iv is the initialization vector for symmetric encryption.$provider
            is the cryptographic provider for the current operation. If the provider is not specified,
            the implementation will use the
            default provider. If the provider does not exist, this is an error [err:CX23].
            6.2 The crypto:decrypt functionThis function decrypts data.
            crypto:decrypt($data as xs:anyAtomicType,
            $decryption-type as xs:string,
            $secret-key as xs:anyAtomicType,
            $cryptographic-algorithm as xs:string,
            $vi as xs:string?,
            $provider as xs:string?) as xs:anyAtomicType$data is the data to be decrypted. This
            parameter can be of type xs:string, xs:base64Binary, or xs:hexBinary.
            When a particular padding mechanism is requested, but is not available, this is an
            error [err:CX16]. Also, when a particular padding mechanism is expected, but
            the data is not padded properly, this is an error [err:CX17].$decryption-type is the
            type of decryption. Legal values:
            "symmetric", and "asymmetric". If the parameter has an illegal value, this is
            an error [err:CX22].$secret-key is the secret key used for decryption. This parameter
            can be of type xs:string,
            xs:base64Binary, or xs:hexBinary. If the key is invalid, this is an error [err:CX19].
            If the length of
            data provided to the block cipher is incorrect, this is an error [err:CX20].$cryptographic-algorithm
            is the cryptographic algorithm used for decryption. For symmetric decryption, a transformation
            name can be used.
            If the parameter specifies an unsupported algorithm or transformation name, this is
            an error [err:CX21].
            $iv is the initialization vector for symmetric encryption.$provider is the cryptographic
            provider for the current operation. If the provider is not specified, the implementation
            will use the
            default provider. If the provider does not exist, this is an error [err:CX23]. 
            7 Secure Storing of Sensitive Keying and Data MaterialA secure storage is a collection
            of CRLs, cryptographic keys, cryptographic certificates, cryptographic certificate
            chains,
            various secrets, and extensions. It may have different implementation, according to

            1 IntroductionThis module is designed to help datatypes handling, providing conversions
            between datatypes that are not covered by casts mentioned in
            [XPath and XQuery Functions and Operators 3.0].
            1.1 Namespace conventionsThe module defined by this document defines functions and
            elements in the namespace
            http://expath.org/ns/datatype-conversion. In this document, the
            dt-conv prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace URI.Error codes are defined
            in the namespace http://expath.org/ns/error. In
            this document, the err prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace
            URI.
            1.2 Error managementError conditions are identified by a code (a QName). When such
            an error
            condition is reached during the execution of the function, a dynamic error is thrown,
            with the corresponding error code (as if the standard XPath function
            error had been called). 
            2 xs:base64Binary to other datatypesThese functions provide conversion from xs:base64Binary
            datatype to other datatypes.

            $data is the data to be converted.
            2.2 The dt-conv:base64Binary-to-string functionThis function converts from xs:base64Binary
            to xs:string.
            dt-conv:base64Binary-to-string($data as xs:base64Binary?) as xs:string?
            
            dt-conv:base64Binary-to-string($data as xs:base64Binary?,
            		$encoding as xs:string) as xs:string?
            $data is the data to be converted.$encoding is the encoding used for conversion. The
            default value is UTF-8. If it is specified an unsupported encoding, this
            is an error [err:DTCONV01]. 
            3 xs:byte to other datatypesThese functions provide conversion from xs:byte datatype
            to other datatypes.

            Conditions 
            1 IntroductionThis File Transfer Client interface allows using of various file transfer
            protocols, including well-known ones, such as FTP, SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol),
            		    FTPS (FTP over implicit SSL/TLS), FTPES (FTP over explicit SSL/TLS), WebDAV
            (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning), and WebDAVS (WebDAV encrypted via
            SSL),
            		    as well as custom defined protocols.The specification was made so that to cover
            the operations involved as to managing (remote) resources (files and directories).A
            custom protocol can make use of any number of the operations over files described
            below, in this manner assuring a very elastic approach of the (remote) resources
            		    (files and directories) management.
            1.1 Namespace conventionsThe module defined by this document defines functions and
            elements in the namespace
            http://expath.org/ns/ft-client. In this document, the
            		  ft-client prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace URI.Error codes are defined
            in the namespace http://expath.org/ns/error. In
            this document, the err prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace
            URI.
            1.2 Error managementError conditions are identified by a code (a QName). When such
            an error
            condition is reached during the execution of the function, a dynamic error is thrown,
            with the corresponding error code (as if the standard XPath function
            error had been called). 
            2 The ft-client:connect functionThis function is used to open a connection. It returns
            an xs:long representing the connection handle.All data connections should originate
            from an authorized party (host and port). In case when a data connection originated
            from an unauthorized party, this is
            			an error [err:FTC001].In case when a server closes a connection, an error [err:FTC002]
            will be raised.In case when credentials used (username, password, or private key)
            are wrong, an error [err:FTC005] will be raised.In case when the protocol used is
            not supported, an error [err:FTC006] will be raised.
            ft-client:connect($remote-host-uri as xs:anyURI) as xs:long
            
            ft-client:connect($remote-host-uri as xs:anyURI,
            		$options as xs:anyAtomicType) as xs:long
            
            			    $remote-host-uri is the URI of the host to connect to. See [rfc2396] in order
            to provide a correct syntax for this parameter.
            			    $options represents the options needed for the current operation. 
            3 The ft-client:list-resources functionThis function gets the list of resources (files
            and directories) inside the directory indicated by $remote-directory-path.
            ft-client:list-resources($connection-handle as xs:long,
            	$remote-directory-path as xs:string) as element(ft-client:resources-list)
            
            $connection-handle is the connection handle.$remote-directory-path is the directory
            path (this path has to be an absolute path). If the path is not correct,
            				this is an error [err:FTC003]. If the user has no rights
            			to access the path, this is an error [err:FTC004].
            3.1 The ft-client:resource-list elementThe ft-client:resource-list element represents
            the data sent back by the host as response to the command of listing a directory:
            &lt;ft-client:resource-list&gt;
            	(ft-client:resource*)
            &lt;/ft-client:resource-list&gt;
            
            3.2 The ft-client:resource elementThe ft-client:resource element contains details
            about each resource (directory, file, link) one can find within the directory.The
            content of the resource is returned as the content of this element.
            &lt;ft-client:resource
            name = xs:string
            type = "directory" | "file" | "link"
            last-modified = xs:dateTime
            size = xs:integer
            human-readable-size = xs:string
            user = xs:string
            user-group = xs:string
            permissions = xs:string
            link-to = xs:string?&gt;
            xs:string?
            &lt;/ft-client:resource&gt;
            
            name is the name of the resource.
            
            type is the type of the resource.
            last-modified is the date and time of the last modification of the resource.
            size is the size of the resource, expressed in bytes.human-readable-size is the size
            of the resource, expressed in a human readable format.user is the name of the resource's
            owner.user-group is the name of the group of the resource's owner.permissions is the
            resource's permissions.link-to is the resource the current resource points to. 
            4 The ft-client:store-resource functionThis function stores a resource (directory,
            file). It returns true if successfully completed, false if not.This function is designated
            to accomplish the following tasks:
            					store a directory on the host, when $remote-resource-path ends with '/'; 
            					if the directory already exists, it will be overwritten;
            					store a file on the host, when $remote-resource-path does not end with '/';
            					if the file already exists, it is overwritten; the file's contents is
            					passed through the $resource-contents parameter;
            					in case when this parameter is empty or missing, the
            					file will be empty;
            ft-client:store-resource($connection-handle as xs:long,
            	$remote-resource-path as xs:string,

            		$connection-handle is the connection handle.$remote-resource-path is the path for
            resource to be created (this path has to be an absolute path). If the path is not
            correct,
            					this is an error [err:FTC003]. If the user has no rights
            					to access the path, this is an error [err:FTC004].
            					$resource-contents is the contents of the resource to be stored (in case of storing
            a file). 
            5 The ft-client:retrieve-resource functionThis function retrieves a resource from
            the host. It returns the resource retrieved, as content of the ft-client:resource
            element.
            ft-client:retrieve-resource($connection-handle as xs:long,

            					to access the path, this is an error [err:FTC004].
            					$new-name is the new name for the resource. 
            7 The ft-client:copy-resource functionThis function renames a resource (directory,
            file, or link). It returns true if successfully completed, false if not.
